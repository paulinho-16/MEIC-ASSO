`Classes` and `teachers` must be checked for authenticity. These entities must exist. Through [Backend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/BackendIntegration) the classes and teachers are checked through the `/curricular-unit` endpoint for their existence.
Communication and processing faults are replied with an [Error Report](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/quality/qualityManagementAndGovernance/ErrorReport) where the response message indicates and classifies the fault in a simple, machine-readable way.

## Future Work

Interesting things that could be done are the implementation of [Conditional Request](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/quality/dataTransferParsimony/ConditionalRequest) in order to avoid unnecessary server-side processing and bandwidth usage be avoided when invoking API operations that return rarely changing data and the implementation of [Request Bundle](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/quality/dataTransferParsimony/RequestBundle) to assemble multiple requests into a single request message.
