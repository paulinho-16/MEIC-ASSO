# NAGIOS Monitoring

To add new hosts and endpoints to be monitored you can either extend the `uni4all.cfg` configuration file with new services or create a new one. If you create a new configuration file you need to update the `nagios.cfg` file with its path as exemplified for the `uni4all.cfg` and `monitoring.cfg` files.
